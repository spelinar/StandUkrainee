        Our team have created ActAgainstWar to support efforts of stopping the war. We do not procure any revenue from
        this effort and we are thankful to our friends from Scandit for waiving their fees on their brilliant scanning
        service. If you'd like to support us as well, we welcome your contributions to cover our operational costs
        (coming soon).
